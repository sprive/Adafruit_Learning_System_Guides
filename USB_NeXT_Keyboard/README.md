## USB NeXT Keyboard

NeXT non-ADB Keyboard to USB converter

This will take an older NeXT keyboard, talk to it, and turn the keycodes into a USB keyboard

The accompanying tutorial is available at https://learn.adafruit.com/usb-next-keyboard-with-arduino-micro/

Requires an Arduino Micro for the USB portion - but could be ported to another micro fairly easily
